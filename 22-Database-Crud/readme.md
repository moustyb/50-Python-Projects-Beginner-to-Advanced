- Using Python’s built‑in sqlite3 module
- Executing SQL commands
- Designing simple database tables
- Handling user input and mapping it to database operations
- Understanding how CRUD logic works in real applications

✅ main.py
(This section normally contains the Python code, but you requested no code inside.)

✅ requirements.txt
